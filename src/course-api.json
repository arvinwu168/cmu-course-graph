The course is focused entirely on project design work (this is not an historical survey, technical or lecture course). This course is very hands-on  Projects will explore the design and experience of spatial environments through a series of creative investigations. The semester will be broken in to 3 parts:Intro/Exploration and a long term project. In Intro/Exploration, students will have many hands on opportunities to start to build a common language to describe spacial investigations as well as creating them. This will consist of short projects, with each design investigation progressively building upon the previous exploration; these early projects will consist of both individual and group work. They will focus on Making.  The second half of the semester will consist of one long term project to be created individually, incorporating students? personal theories of architecture based on an overarching question.  Studio work will be supported by group discussion based upon critical review of student work, readings, slide presentations, videos and films. There will also be a few field trips. Students are encouraged to explore their own areas of interest with respect to their work in class. Self-motivation, class attendance and an open mind is mandatory, however, no prior architectural, engineering or artistic experience is required. Students are expected to perform work both inside and outside of class. Students should be prepared to purchase various supplies throughout the course.

The prototype brings with it the physical instantiation of design ideas at larger scale and in actual materials to provide the designer with the feedback of material qualities and performance.  The prototyping process is a potential vehicle for discovery in which affordances of fabrication processes and unanticipated results expand the realm of possibilities and challenge assumptions of linear design to fabrication processes. The course places great emphasis upon the reciprocity of design and prototyping, challenging students to leverage physical artifacts as tools for thinking. Prototyping is a means of exploration, not merely a method of production or fabrication.   Selecting an architectural condition from a previous design project, students utilize modeling, prototyping, and simulating to develop a detailed architectural element. Students produce a series of versions of their architectural element culminating in a final prototype and collection of digital representations.  The course is structured as two modules. Module 1 provides a historical and theoretical background of digital fabrication in architecture, while asking students to identify significant references related to their architectural element, its potential material makeup, construction system, and fabrication process(es).

Bacteria are a scourge to humankind, causing life-threatening infections like tuberculosis, meningitis, and pneumonia to the less severe ear infections and strep throats that plague many childhoods. On the other hand, the healthy human microbiota is a community of microorganisms dominated by trillions of bacteria that reside everywhere from our skin to nasal passages and gut. This virtual organ is estimated to weigh as much as the human brain and contributes to essential bodily functions like food metabolism and defense against infection, while also impacting memory, anxiety, and depression. Changes in the gut microbiota are also associated with diseases including autism, obesity, allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease. Why the incidence of these chronic diseases is increasing is unclear, but it may be the result of excessive antibiotic use, dietary changes that harm our gut microbes, or both. This century will be marked by both the challenge of antibiotic resistant infectious bad bacteria, and the possibilities to harness good bacteria to promote human health. In this course, we explore how bacteria make you healthy and what we can do to nurture our microbiota, and how bacteria make you sick and what we can do to stop them.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

We will emphasize technology-related privacy concerns and mitigation, for example: social networks, smartphones, behavioral advertising (and tools to prevent targeted advertising and tracking), anonymous communication systems, big data, and drones. This is part of a series of courses offered as part of the MSIT-Privacy Engineering masters program. These courses may be taken in any order or simultaneously. Foundations of Privacy (Fall semester) offers more in-depth coverage of technologies and algorithms used to reason about and protect privacy. Engineering Privacy in Software (Spring semester) focuses on the methods and tools needed to design systems for privacy. This course is intended primarily for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students with some technical background. Programming skills are not required. 8-733, 19-608, and 95-818 are 12-unit courses for PhD students. Students enrolled under these course numbers will have extra assignments and will be expected to do a project suitable for publication. 8-533 is a 9-unit course for undergraduate students. Masters students may register for any of the course numbers permitted by their program. This course will include a lot of reading, writing, and class discussion. Students will be able to tailor their assignments to their skills and interests.

How can we anticipate how sales and profits change if the firm changes its business strategy? Facebook, Google, Amazon and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms. This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild and in network settings. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and can be applied in settings other than online platforms such as energy, transportation and education. The examples in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at the Heinz College on the media industry. Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts behind A/B tests and what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas and intuition behind these concepts.

Fall 2020: The Birth of Modern Media Before the internet, English-speaking people got their news and connected with each other through the printed word, live performances on the stage, and the pleasures of visual media.  Engraved portraits of celebrities promoted glamor and fashion, and political cartoons helped to shape political parties. The period between 1660 and 1830 saw an explosion of newspapers and visual media, and theaters expanded from seating  a few hundred to pleasure palaces accommodating thousands.  New media forms, like the modern novel and musical theater, were gobbled up by audiences hungry for innovation.  It was an age of experiment in gender and sexuality as well as media, an age in which cross-dressing flourished, and modern ideas of sexual conformityand transgressioncame into being.  Race entered European consciousness through the distorting lens of the African slave trade and the growth of consumer desire for merchandise from continents to the east and west of the British Empire.

Students in data-driven majors will find the section useful preparation for communicating in their disciplines. Students in other fields will learn how to critique and respond to the many ways that numbers shape our lives.

How do these representations engage differences of gender, race, class, and sexuality?

How do different genres negotiate gendered identities? The course will take a self-reflexive turn by asking students to examine the role that gender plays in the creation of their taste and pleasure.

Historically, radios were hardware-dependent and fixed to a specific signal waveform. Your modern smartphone implements several individual radios (2G, 3G, 4G, WiFi, GPS, FM radio, Bluetooth, etc). A software-defined radio would adapt to these different waveforms and receive all of them with one radio. In this course, we will study the end-to-end processes involved in radio transmitters and receivers (or transceivers) such as modulation/demodulation, coding/decoding, amplification, etc. Using a physical device to implement the front-end of the receiver, we will design the other processes in software; for example, we can design an FM software-defined receiver to receive existing FM radio signals in Kigali. We will also visualize spectrum occupancy by developing a simple spectrum analyzer in software that covers from very low to GHz frequency range.

How does scientific development and discourse impact cultural production? How did the scientific revolution play out in early modern Spain? How did the encounter with American cultures challenge scientific inquiry? What alternatives did it offer? What is the current relationship between science and the humanities in the Hispanic world? This course attempts to answer these questions by focusing on literature and works of art in the Spanish-speaking world throughout time. Improve your Spanish while you discover the complex relationship between science and the humanities. Given the importance of vision and visibility in science, this course is guided by the study of optics, and will also explore other sciences such as astronomy, cartography, medicine, and chemistry.  In this course we will analyze literary texts, works of art, historical documents, case studies, and systems of thought that emerge in the transatlantic Hispanic world. Students will identify key points and developments in the relationship between science and the arts.

Relatedly, is it possible to survive your bodily death, or are you a human animal that will expire when its body dies? If the state of the universe billions of years before you were born and the laws of nature together determine everything anyone will ever do, are we ever morally responsible for our actions? Finally, can a digital computer have a mind like yours, and if so, what are the odds that you are, right now, living in a computer simulation?   Philosophers address tough questions like these by producing intricate and often beautiful arguments. In this course, you will assess those arguments and produce your own. You will learn to think like a philosopher - to strip an argument presented in prose to its bare essentials and plainly expose its structure.

This can lead to ineffective political communication, as conservatives attempt to persuade through purity and tradition based arguments which are not as persuasive to liberals, while liberals attempt to persuade through equality and inclusiveness arguments which are not as persuasive to conservatives.

One way to think about it is as a property of sequences of, say, events, experimental outcomes, observations, or symbols from some alphabet: a sequence is random if it is unruly, irregular, patternless. This conception of randomness plays a significant role in a variety of fields, including cryptography, information theory, the foundations of probability and statistics, computability theory, and certain computational models of learning. To build some intuition, consider the two binary strings 0010111110 and 0101010101. The first string seems more random-looking than the second. This is because the second string displays an obvious pattern that is very easy to describe and that makes it look highly predictable. But can these intuitions be made precise? Is it possible to provide a rigorous mathematical characterization of the notion of a random sequence?    This seminar will provide an introduction to the theory of algorithmic randomnessan active branch of computability theoryaccording to which a sequence is random if it does not display any algorithmically detectable patterns. We will begin by discussing von Mises theory of collectives, a precursor to the theory of algorithmic randomness; then, we will see how von Mises work led to the modern computability-theoretic approach to randomness. We will focus on both the mathematical details of the theory of algorithmic randomness and its philosophical consequences. We will pay special attention to the connections between randomness, probability, and the philosophical interpretations of probability.

Are considerations of justice primarily (or only) domestic in scope, or can individuals and institutions have justice-based obligations to individuals and institutions in other nations?  This section of the course will engage contemporary contributions to the debate between so-called nationalists and cosmopolitans about justice.  Second: if obligations of justice are rooted in shared institutions, to what extent do shared institutions govern the life chances of global citizens?  Many scholars in both the nationalist and cosmopolitan camps argue that some feature or features of shared institutions ground obligations of justice, and so the debate regarding the scope of justice claims becomes a debate about the nature and influence of global institutions. During this section of the course, we will consider in particular various institutions of global health and the extent to which those institutions are capable of grounding justice-based claims to access to health, healthcare, and access to the material and epistemic benefits of biomedical progress.

Health policy is supported by:  -    Public health initiatives focused on preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health for the entire population. (i.e. diabetes awareness) -    Population health is interested in the outcomes of individual groups and the distribution of outcomes among the groups. (i.e. income equality and infant mortality) -    Healthcare delivery is focused on access, quality, and cost.

Throughout, Public Finance emphasizes the interplay between how current revenue policy is fashioned, and how the models and their key assumptions along with political processes interact which result in changes in current law at the federal, state, and local levels. Public Finance focuses mainly on the revenue side of the public budget. Two courses typically offered by Professor Strauss in the Spring build on Public Finance. Public Expenditure Analysis (90-774/90-474) deals with techniques for evaluating private and public expenditure and capital spending decisions. Education Finance and Policy (90-817) deals in-depth with issues surrounding multi-level government finance from US and international perspectives.  Public Finance is taught in lecture/discussion format with an emphasis on developing each students reasoning skills. Original course lecture outlines in .doc format are maintained in Canvas, along with working Excel examples used in class, and assigned and optional readings.

The resulting fiscal relationships have been controversial, with Washington spending trillions in grants and other assistance, but with conditions, or strings that state and local governments often find onerous and intrusive.  Furthermore, federal budget deficits are now forcing political leaders in Washington to find ways to curtail spending, with many assistance programs potentially on the chopping block and states left to enforce federal standards with less money. This seminar examines the decisions political leaders at all levels of government must make to pay for the public good.  Should highways, for example, be funded by users (through tolls), by vehicle owners (through a gasoline tax) or by all taxpayers (who benefit from highways even if they do not drive)?  Should the federal government be forcing states to implement federal standards, like raising the drinking age as a condition for receiving federal highway funds?  How will such developing technologies and behaviors as electric vehicles and ride sharing change the economics and politics of funding our transportation infrastructure?  How can the federal government balance the budget without shortchanging vital national priorities? The seminar will focus on the tough choices policymakers face over funding sources and spending at all levels of government through case studies that illustrate the issues.  Students will develop case studies and briefing papers, and will lead class discussions that explore how federal, state and local interests can align or collide depending on the issue.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent the latest effort by the international community to encourage and facilitate broad-based progress across multiple sectors in individual countries.  The SDGs reflect an optimists perspective regarding international development. Optimists highlight the tremendous progress in improving the quality of human life that has been made during the past 200 years, and in particular since the end of World War II. Building on this record, achieving the SDGs will mark a notable step forward in addressing the most serious inequities that exist across the globe, including extreme poverty, food insecurity, illiteracy, and inadequate health care. SDGs aside, pessimists worry about the enormous challenges currently confronting the international community. They note that by 2050 global population will reach 9.6 billion people. To feed an increasingly affluent number of people, we will need 70 percent more food production and a doubling of available water and arable land, which will come at the expense of existing natural systems. The availability of these essential inputs is further complicated by the reality that the planet is undergoing vast biological and physical changes due to climate change and environmental degradation. Human communities are changing as well. More than 50 percent of the worlds population live in urban areas and 75 percent of the worlds largest cities will be found in the developing world over the next few decades. These mega-urban areas create their own challenges from the spread of pandemic diseases, to sanitation, to energy needs.

Systems Engineering is a formal discipline that guides a product from conception and design all the way to production, marketing, servicing, and disposal. The higher the complexity of the system, the more its creators benefit from applying formal processes such as Systems Engineering to its development.

Students will gain a perspective of various current theories and models of innovation, how innovations are brought to the market and positioned for successful launch and subsequent growth.  Students study and discuss both successful and unsuccessful attempts to bring innovations to the market via a series of lectures, readings, and case discussions.  The first mini course focuses on the upfront strategic market thinking that must be the basis of a proactive and potent business plan to introduce innovations to the marketplace.  It is the result of intense understanding of the SET factors (social, economic, and technology) and industry dynamics into which the opportunity will be introduced.  It is strategic because of rapid changes in the marketplace and the competitive-set which the opportunity must confront for execution in the emerging marketplace (emergent strategy or agile approach).

In this course we?ll talk about why this happens and how to fix it. You will get intense practical training in communicating a concise message under tense or adversarial conditions. You will learn techniques for handling tough questions and for getting your own point-of-view across in any forum where you need to think fast on your feet.     You will also learn to use your voice and body language to reinforce the message you put into words.     We use the process of being interviewed by a reporter as the major vehicle for developing and strengthening your executive communication skills. In the process you will learn how to?      get across to an audience a message that you want to convey about an issue your organization is grappling with      increase your credibility with a skeptical or hostile audience      increase your confidence and poise during interactions with reporters shareholders investment analysts legislators public interest groups or worried employees.

Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic).  Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision making.

If time permits polynomial time solvability of linear programs, extensions to conic optimization problems, conic duality, and an introduction to interior point methods are topics of interest in the given order.", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Linear Programming", "units": 6.0, "department": "Tepper School of Business", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "10:40AM", "end": "12:30PM", "building": "CMU", "room": "REMOTE", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A1", "instructors": ["Hooker, John"]}], "sections": []}, "47-835": {"desc": "This is a graduate-level course on introductory graph theory.
